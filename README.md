# Chess Visualizer - A Student Project Inspired by Chess.com and the ChatGPT vs Stockfish Match

## Introduction

This project is my personal tribute to the amazing world of online chess, particularly inspired by Chess.com's interface and the epic AI showdown between ChatGPT and Stockfish. My goal was to blend my love for chess with my coding skills to create something both fun and educational.

## Key Features

Dynamic Chess Board: Just like the interactive boards on Chess.com, my project updates the board in real-time as moves are made.
Reliving ChatGPT vs Stockfish: I've programmed the game to recreate the famous match between ChatGPT and Stockfish, allowing users to experience each move.
User-Friendly Move Navigation: Simple 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons let users go through the game at their own pace, a feature I always appreciated on online chess platforms.
Customized Look: I've added a personal touch with custom images for each chess piece and unique logos representing ChatGPT and Stockfish.
Interactive Move History: A sidebar shows all the moves made, complete with a scrolling feature for better navigation.
Engaging Sound Effects: Different sound effects for various moves to make the game more immersive.
Special Moves Visualization: Special moves like castling are visually represented for better understanding.
Scrollable Move History: Easy navigation through the game's move history with an interactive scrollbar.

2. ChatGPT vs Stockfish Match: This historic AI vs AI chess match fascinated me, and I wanted to bring it to life in my project.
